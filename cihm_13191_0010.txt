acquired the acquittal of his client, but incurred the
enmity os the dictator. With the ostensible object
of regaining his health he went to Athens, where he
studied philosophy under Antiochus, the Academic,
and under Zeno and Phaedrus, both Epicureans.
From Athens he travelled through Asia Minor and
finally settled sor a short time at Rhodes, attending
there the lecture< of Molo, the rhetorican. Return-
ing home, he at once entered on that political career
to which his commanding ability destined him, and
was elected quaestor of Sicily. During his term of
office he so endeared himself to the inhabitants of the
island by his integrity that they selected him as their
patron at Rome. In their behalf he subsequently
conducted the prosecution against Verres, who was
charged with extortion. His success in this cause,
and his consequent popularity, procured him the
office os curule aedile. After the usual interval he
was chosen praetor, and, while holding this office,
delivered the first of his political harangues, in de·

Pompey with supreme command in the Mithradatic
War. Two years afterwards he gained the consul-
slup, the goal of his ambition. His consulate is
memorable for the bold attempt of Catiline to sub-

trated by the patriotic zeal of the consul. Cicero had
quickly soared to the pinnacle of fame : as quickly
did he fall. In crushing the conspiracy os Catiline
questionable means had been employed. Clodius,
his implacable enemy, revived a law exiling all who
had been guilty of putting to death Roman citizens
without a formal trial before the people. The
Triumvirs‚ too, were disgusted with the vanity of the
man who was constantly reminding the people that
he was the “Saviour of Italy '' and the “ F ather of
