cllum: see Proper N ames—mediocriter ktbefizctantem: Cicero
designedly extenuates the guilt of Gracchus to heighten the
crimes of Catiline. In fact, the orator represents the guilt of
Gracchus in different lights according to the exigencies of his
cause: cp. De Leg. Ag.‚ 2, 5, 10: De Off. ΙῙ., 12. 43.
Catilinam: emphatic position: “Catiline‚ desiring to devas-
tate the world with sword and fire shall we consuls tolerate ? ’'—
orbis terrae: there is little difference between orbes terrae and
arlais termnum—caede atque incendit& ε also fhrro et igni.

2illa ε “the following instance ε ” though only the case of
Ahala is mentioned, the plural is probably used to intimate that
other cases might be adduced.

³C. Servilius Ahala z see Proper Names.

&zonis-studentem: “aiming to overturn the government :’'
cp. νεωτερίζειν.

⁵fuit-suit : note the emphatic repetition of the word (eptkeuxis).
ista virtus: here ista=illa ι “that well-known public spirit: ''
We may take virtuszamor patriae: ‘⁶ patriotism.''

6truh-coercerent: “that brave men inflicted severer punish·
ment on a saetious citizen then on the bitterest foe ''-supplicii.s·:
abl. means.

⁷senatus consultum: the decree arming the consuls with civil
and military power. The formula was videant consules ne quid
respublica detrimenti capiat.

Svelzemens et grave: “ full of force and severity.''

9νεί publicae: generally taken as a dative aster deest: others
take it as a genitive depending on consilium, i.e., there is no
lack os precedents of the state, i.e.‚ the state have many in·
stances os wicked citizens being punished. The state, accord-
ing to Cicero, has enough of wisdom (consilium) and determin-
ing authority (auctoritas), 'but the executive power is weak.

CHAPTER II.

§4 ¹quomlam: B.C. 121 ι see C. Gracchus, in Proper
Names. In a decree of this kind both consuls were named.
The other, Q. Fabius, was at that time ιη that part of Gaul
known afterwards as Provincia, and his absence from Rome
may account sor the omission of his name from the decree.

²intercessit: i.e., between the passing of the decree and the
death os Gracchus. . ·

³propter--suspiciones τ another case of extenuation to bring out
more vividly the guilt of Catiline. Distinguish suspicio, suspicio.
