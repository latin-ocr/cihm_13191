commenced his career by slaying, with his own hand,
Q. Caecilius, his own brother-in·law‚ and by torturing
to death M. Marius Gratidiaan a kinsman of Cicero.
Though his youth was spent in open debanehery, and
reckless extravagance‚ though he made away with
his first wife and his son to marry the worthless and
profligate Aurelia Orestilla, the guilty crimes of
Catiline do not seem to have been any barrier to his
advancement to political honors. He obtained the
praetorship B.C. 68, and in the following year was
propraetor of Africa. He returned to Rome B.C. 66
to pre-is his suit sor the consulship. The two consuls
¹. 'fo had the highest votes were P. Autronius Paetus
and P. Cornelius Sulla, both os whom were convicted
of bribery‚ and their election was declared void.
Their places were filled by L. Aurelius Cotta and L.
Manlius Torquatus. Catiline was prevented from
being a candidate in consequence of an irnpeachment
brought against him for mal-administration of las
province of Mum by P. Clodius Pulcher, afterwards
the implacable enemy of Cicero. Autronius and
Catiline, exasperated by their disappointment, formed
a league with Cn. Calpurnius Piso to murder the
consuls on the first of January, to seize the fasces,
and to occupy Spain. The plan leaked out, and was
postponed till the fifth of February. The scheme,
however, failed in consequence os Catiline giving the
signal too soon. Resolutions were passed by the
senate condemning the conspiracy, but these were

quashed by the intercession os a tribune. Some say

that both Caesar and Crassus were involved in this
First Conspiracy of Catiline. About this time,
Catiline was acquitted of extortion (res repetundae),
but the trial rendered him penniless. About the
beginning of June, 64 B.C., he began to plot more
systematically to carry out his plans sor a general
